**A tiny, zero-dependency replacement for Python's `zipfile.ZipFile` for creating reproducible/deterministic ZIP archives.**

"Reproducible" or "deterministic" in this context means that the binary content of the ZIP archive is identical if you add files with identical binary content in the same order. It means you can reliably check equality of the contents of two ZIP archives by simply comparing checksums of the archive using a hash function like MD5 or SHA-256.

This Python package provides a `ReproducibleZipFile` class that works exactly like [`zipfile.ZipFile`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html#zipfile-objects) from the Python standard library, except that all files written to the archive have their last-modified timestamps set to a fixed value.

## Installation

repro-zipfile is available from PyPI. To install, run:

```bash
pip install repro-zipfile
```

It is also available from conda-forge. To install, run:

```bash
conda install repro-zipfile -c conda-forge
```

## Usage

Simply import `ReproducibleZipFile` and use it in the same way you would use [`zipfile.ZipFile`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html#zipfile-objects) from the Python standard library.

```python
from repro_zipfile import ReproducibleZipFile

with ReproducibleZipFile("archive.zip", "w") as zp:
    # Use write to add a file to the archive
    zp.write("examples/data.txt", arcname="data.txt")
    # Or writestr to write data to the archive
    zp.writestr("lore.txt", data="goodbye")
```

Note that files must be written to the archive in the same order to reproduce an identical archive. Be aware that functions that like `os.listdir`, `os.glob`, `Path.iterdir`, and `Path.glob` return files in a nondeterministic order—you should call `sorted` on their returned values first.

See [`examples/usage.py`](./examples/usage.py) for an example script that you can run, and [`examples/demo_vs_zipfile.py`](./examples/demo_vs_zipfile.py) for a demonstration in contrast with the standard library's zipfile module.

### Set timestamp value with SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH

repro_zipfile supports the `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` environment variable. If set, it will be used as a fixed value for the modified timestamps of files added to an archive. This should be an integer corresponding to the [Unix epoch time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) of the timestamp you want to set. `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` is a [standard](https://reproducible-builds.org/docs/source-date-epoch/) created by the [Reproducible Builds project](https://reproducible-builds.org/) for software distributions.

## How does repro-zipfile work?

The primary reason that ZIP archives aren't automatically reproducible is because they include last-modified timestamps of files. This means that files with identical content but with different last-modified times cause the resulting ZIP archive to be different. `repro_zipfile.ReproducibleZipFile` is a subclass of `zipfile.ZipFile` that overrides the `write` and `writestr` methods to set the modified timestamp of all files written to the archive to a fixed value. By default, this value is 1980-01-01 0:00 UTC, which is the earliest timestamp that is supported by the ZIP format. You can customize this value as documented in the previous section. Note that repro-zipfile does not modify the original files—only the metadata written to the archive.

You can effectively reproduce what `ReproducibleZipFile` does with something like this:

```python
from zipfile import ZipFile

with ZipFile("archive.zip", "w") as zp:
    # Use write to add a file to the archive
    zp.write("examples/data.txt", arcname="data.txt")
    zinfo = zp.getinfo("data.txt")
    zinfo.date_time = (1980, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0)
    # Or writestr to write data to the archive
    zp.writestr("lore.txt", data="goodbye")
    zinfo = zp.getinfo("lore.txt")
    zinfo.date_time = (1980, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0)
```

It's not hard to do, but we believe `ReproducibleZipFile` is sufficiently more convenient to justify a small package!

## Why care about reproducible ZIP archives?

ZIP archives are often useful when dealing with a set of multiple files, especially if the files are large and can be compressed. Creating reproducible ZIP archives is often useful for:

- **Building a software package.** This is a development best practice to make it easier to verify distributed software packages. See the [Reproducible Builds project](https://reproducible-builds.org/) for more explanation.
- **Working with data.** Verify that your data pipeline produced the same outputs, and avoid further reprocessing of identical data.
- **Packaging machine learning model artifacts.** Manage model artifact packages more effectively by knowing when they contain identical models.
